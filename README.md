Just wanted to fork this in case any changes were needed and to catalogue that it works for Wii U. 


# Oneshot For Wii
A Port of the Freeware (2014) Ver. of Oneshot for the Wii. Thanks to derric young for giving the idea to me after he had problems himself to get it to work on his wii.
Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your Wii: First of all you need to have a Modded Wii with Homebrew or else it wont work.

**Wii U users can use the latest version of EasyRPG for Wii U (.wuhb) and it *should* work fine**!


# Wii Instructions:
1. Download EasyRPG Wii by going to https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/#release-other (0.8.0 breaks the port so using 0.7.0 is neccesary) and the zip that says `EasyRPG_Player-0.7.0-Wii.zip`
2. Download the Oneshot folder in the release tab.
3. Extract the EasyRPG_Player-0.7.0-Wii.zip file and add it in the "apps" folder if it exists
4. Add the Oneshot Wii Build in the same folder as easyRPG's "Boot.dol" file (that should be in EasyRPG's folder)
5. Open up EasyRPG in Homebrew and if you see Oneshot, congrats! You can now play oneshot on your Wii!
Have fun!!!


# Wii U Instructions:
1. Download EasyRPG Wii U by going to https://ci.easyrpg.org/view/Pull%20Requests/job/player-wiiu-pr/ (as of 9/7/24, the Wii U releases are still a bit experimental) and downloading `easyrpg-player.wuhb`
2. Download Oneshot in the "Releases" section
3. Place `easyrpg-player.wuhb` in `SD:/wiiu/apps/easyrpg-player/`
4. Place the release build in `SD:/wiiu/apps/easyrpg-player/`
5. Launch it the app, and you're set to go
